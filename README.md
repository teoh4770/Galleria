# Gallaria

> A PHP slideshow site showcases famous drawing in the past

Gallaria is a slideshow site I built with Vanilla PHP and JavaScript, based on a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/profile/teoh4770). I initially put it on hold for about 6 months because the CSS layout felt a bit tricky at the time. After starting to learn PHP as my first official backend language for web in June 2024, I decided to give it another shot and managed to complete it within a week. I created this side project to have a reference for refreshing my PHP and MVC structure basics in the future.

Gallaria is a slideshow site I built with Vanilla PHP and JavaScript, inspired by a [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/galleria-slideshow-site-tEA4pwsa6). I paused it for 6 months due to tricky CSS, but after picking up PHP in June 2024, I finished it within a week. This project now serves as a reference for refreshing my PHP and MVC basics.
