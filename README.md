> A PHP slideshow site showcases famous drawing in the past

Gallaria is a slideshow site I built with Vanilla PHP and JavaScript, inspired by a [Frontend Mentor challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/galleria-slideshow-site-tEA4pwsa6). I paused it for 6 months due to tricky CSS, but after picking up PHP in June 2024, I finished it within a week. This project now serves as a reference for refreshing my PHP and MVC basics.
